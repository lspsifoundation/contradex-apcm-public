# Contradex APCM

Contradex APCM is a distributed architectural ecosystem focused on deterministic evolution of logic and semantics.

## Core Principle

Architecture defines implementation.

## Ecosystem Layers

- Core (protected gravity center)
- Labs (evolution zones)
- Commercial layer (integration surface)

## Architectural Authority

Contradex evolves through validated architectural decisions.

Public repositories represent research and collaboration layers.

Core systems exist as protected stability zones and are not driven by direct feature contributions.

Architecture leads implementation.

## Important

This repository is a public architectural interface.
Core implementation is intentionally isolated.

See COLLABORATION.md for research collaboration.
