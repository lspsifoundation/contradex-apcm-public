# Contradex APCM

Contradex APCM is a distributed architectural ecosystem focused on deterministic evolution of logic and semantics.

## Core Principle

Architecture defines implementation.

## Ecosystem Layers

- Core (protected gravity center)
- Labs (evolution zones)
- Commercial layer (integration surface)

## Important

This repository is a public architectural interface.
Core implementation is intentionally isolated.

See COLLABORATION.md for research collaboration.
