# Collaboration & Research Entry

Contradex is an architectural ecosystem focused on deterministic evolution of systems, logic, and semantics.

## Current State

* Core systems are maintained as protected stability zones.
* Public repositories represent architectural direction and research layers.
* Collaboration happens primarily through experimental laboratories.

## We Are Looking For

### Research Engineer

* systems research
* architectural experimentation
* low-level / no_std mindset is a plus

### Integration Engineer

* prototype integration
* adapter design between systems
* experimental tooling

## How to Start

1. Read the architecture overview.
2. Explore discussions and research threads.
3. Open a discussion or reach out directly.

Open to research collaboration and systems-level discussions.
